# Quest ArUco Marker Tracking

This repository enables **single and multi-marker detection and tracking** using OpenCV with the **Passthrough Camera API** for Meta Quest 3/3S.  
It provides sample scenes that support both ArUco(Single/Multi) and ChArUco(Single) markers for augmented reality applications on Quest devices.  
  
For a demonstration, check out the following videos:

## Dependencies

âš  **Important Notice**  
When opening the project for the first time, you will likely encounter errors. This is because **OpenCV for Unity** is not yet installed.  
**Please ignore the errors initially, proceed to open the project, and install OpenCV for Unity manually.**

This project uses **OpenCV for Unity**.  
Please purchase and install it from the Unity Asset Store:  
[OpenCV for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-for-unity-21088?locale=en-US)

Tested with **OpenCV for Unity v2.6.5**.

## Usage

### Marker Preparation
To use this project, please download and install the required marker files from the following links:

- **ArUco Markers**: [ArUcoMarker.pdf](https://github.com/TakashiYoshinaga/QuestArUcoMarkerTracking/blob/main/ArUcoMarker.pdf)  
- **ChArUco Marker**: [ChArUcoMarker.pdf](https://github.com/TakashiYoshinaga/QuestArUcoMarkerTracking/blob/main/ChArUcoMarker.pdf)

### Unity Scenes

- **ArUco Marker Tracking (Single & Multi)**: `ArUcoMarkerTracking.unity`  
- **ChArUco Marker Tracking**: `ChArUcoMarkerTracking.unity`

### Default Settings

#### ArUco Marker
- Marker Dictionary: **DICT_4X4_50**
- Marker Size: **0.1m**  
Feel free to modify these settings to suit your needs.

#### ChArUco Marker
- Marker Dictionary: **DICT_4X4_50**
- Board Configuration: **5 x 4 squares**
- Square Size: **0.05m**  
These values are used by default in the ChArUco sample scene. Adjust them as needed.

### View Mode Switching
You can switch the view mode by pressing the **A button** on the controller.

### How to Change the Number of ArUco Markers

If you want to track multiple ArUco markers simultaneously or change the number of markers in the scene, follow these steps. 

1. Open the **ArUcoMarkerTracking.unity** scene and select the `ArUcoTrackingAppCoordinator` GameObject.  
2. In the **Inspector**, locate the **ArUcoMarkerTrackingAppCoordinator** component and find the `MarkerGameObjectPairs` array.  
3. Change the size of this array to match the **number of markers** you want to use.  
4. For each **Element**, specify:  
   - **Marker Id**: The ID of the marker you want to detect.  
   - **Game Object**: The GameObject to display on top of the detected marker.  
5. **Important Notes**:  
   - Make sure there are no duplicate Marker IDs across the Elements.  
   - Keep the Marker IDs within the valid range defined by the dictionary you are using (for example, **DICT_4X4_50** allows IDs from `0` to `49`).

Below is an example of how `Marker Id` and `Game Object` pairs are set up in the Inspector:
